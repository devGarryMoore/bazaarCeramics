  <p class="ppara">Bazaar Ceramics Studio has been operating for 20 years.  We started as a small collective, operating in the picturesque township of Hahndorf, South Australia - known for its quality arts and crafts.  Over the years the studio has passed through a number of transformations.  In the first 7 years of its existence - as a co-operative, it was well known for producing quality domestic ware and fine individually designed art pieces.  </p>
